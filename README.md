# hello-world
Hey everyone,

I'm a product manager at a small product development consultancy in Fort Collins, CO called OTL Ventures. We partner with local startups and act as an in-house product team, managing the entire product development lifecycle from conception, to design, to development, through to delivery.

I've wanted to learn to program for a while, but I've had difficulty carving out the necessary time to dedicate to the task. I've recently begun a concerted effort to change that, and I've started with learning HTML and CSS. I hope to progress to JavaScript next, and then onto a scripting language.

I'm excited to learn how to use GitHub, as I know it's an integral tool used by many engineers.
